# Readme

This is a very basic console app I made while stuck in a meeting while working at an insurance company around 2015. It was the start of a project, we had 5 months of non-stop meetings before we were allowed to start work. My laptop was locked down so much that all I had access to was a basic Visual Studio installation.

## Commands

To run `dotnet run`

To exit the game `Ctrl + C` in the terminal window.

There is a .devcontainer for VSCode meaning you don't need to worry about installing dependencies.
